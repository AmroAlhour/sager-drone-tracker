Sager Task 

A simple Server that use socket.io to send the geo-location of the drone . 

Happy Coding : 
```
npm install
npm start
```
Important Note: The Project contains the frontend application. As per the task instructions, the backend server is provided in the repository. To see the application function correctly with real-time data, the backend server must be run locally using the following commands: 

```
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend is configured to connect to the backend at http://localhost:9013. Thank you for the opportunity.
